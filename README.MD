This plugin for Indigo extends the Indigo Home Automation system
with weather, sun and moon information.

A 3-day weather forecast and the expected rain amount for the Netherlands are retrieved from weerlive.nl and buienradar.nl. 
Next to that, it retrieves the current UV index, the UV forecast and calculates the current moon phase. The UV index and moon phase can be used globally.

You can choose in the configuration which types of information you want to retrieve. You can store the information retrieved from the website to Indigo devices for further usage.
